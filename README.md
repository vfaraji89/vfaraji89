## Merhaba, I'm Vahid 👋

Applied AI Operator turning messy problems into clean specs and working solutions.

## What I Do

I bridge the gap between business problems and AI-assissted solutions. 
My specialty is **people data** — understanding context, designing dataflows, and translating complexity into actionable specs that teams can build from.

**My approach:** Problem → Spec → Manage → Ship

## How I Work

I focus on AI tools with daily operarions:

- **Claude Code** & **GitHub Copilot** for development
- **n8n**, **Power Automate** & **UiPath** for workflow automation
- Building specs, dataflows, and product data architectures
   
-  **Python** — actively learning, not confined to it (speciality: numpy,pandas)
-  **AI Frameworks:** LangChain, Agno, Agent Garden (learning & applying)
-  **Automation:** n8n, Power Automate, UiPath (comfortable with these)
-  **Data:** Unstructured data (text data)
-  **Visualization:** Anytool and framework (thanks to AI!)
             
## Current Focus
             
- Learning to ship faster — taking broken products and fixing them efficiently with the right combination of specs, automation, and AI tools.
