## Merhaba, I'm Vahid 👋

Applied AI Operator turning messy problems into clean specs and working solutions.

## What I Do

I bridge the gap between business problems and AI-assissted solutions. 
My specialty is **people data** — understanding context, designing dataflows, and translating complexity into actionable specs that teams can build from.

**My approach:** Problem → Spec → Manage → Ship

## How I Work

I pair with AI tools daily to move faster:

- **Claude Code** & **GitHub Copilot** for development
- - **n8n**, **Power Automate** & **UiPath** for workflow automation
- - Building specs, dataflows, and product data architectures
   
    - ## Tech I Use
   
    - - **Python** — actively learning, not confined to it
      - - **AI Frameworks:** LangChain, Agno, Agent Garden
        - - **Automation:** n8n, Power Automate, UiPath
          - - **Data:** Vector databases, ETL pipelines
            - - **Visualization:** Power BI
             
              - ## Current Focus
             
              - Learning to ship faster — taking broken products and fixing them efficiently with the right combination of specs, automation, and AI tools.
